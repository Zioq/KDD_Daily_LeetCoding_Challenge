# Binary Tree Alogithm

This question is asking us how much do we familiar with some algorithms of Binary Tree.

Before solving this problem, ask yourself how much do know about Binary Tree Data Structure.

Here is a check list

- Binary Tree: (Full Binary Tree / Complete Binary Tree / Perfect Binray tree)
- Binary Tree Traversal: (Pre-Order / In-Order / Post-Order)
- +Graph Search: DFS & BFS
  - DFS(Depth-First Search)
    - Pre-Order
    - In-Order
    - Post-Order
  - BFS(Breadth-First Search)

I add some of tutoral code related to this check list.
